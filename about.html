            <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                The history of our school dates back to more than 6 decades. Srimathy
                Unnamalai Thayammal was the wife of the prominent industrialist, who founded The Tamilnad Mercantile bank, Tuticorin Spinning mills, Sinnamani Unnamalai orphanage, and school. Srimathy Unnamalai Thayammal started a forum called Sachidhanandha Sabai to give awareness to the Hindus about their religion. She also formed a trust called Unnamalai Thayammal Sangam which donated funds to educate the poor in society.
                Her daughter-in-law Mrs. Padmavathy wife of her only son Mr. Ganesan,
                inspired by her Guru Swamy Chithbhavanandha, started a preschool called Sri Saradha Siruvar Kalikoodam, the first of its kind in the whole district to inculcate our culture in the very young age of 3and 4. This has been functioning for the past 60 years, and it has further blossomed into Sri Saradha nursery and primary school, with many extra-curricular activities and an education system based on CBSE.
